# VR-Footystick
Seated and portable VR WIP locomotion concept designed for confined public spaces. The aim is to provide intuitive foot gestures within the constraints of such environ- ments.

I developed the entire model and tasks using Unity and I remapped the locomotion system of the User from to Oculus joystick to a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor.
